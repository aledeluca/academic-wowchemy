# Research

  The main areas of my research are theoretical computer science
  and discrete mathematics. In particular, I am interested in
  *combinatorics on words*, the study of structural and algebraic
  properties of finite and infinite strings of symbols. This
  field has deep connections with number theory, physics,
  biology, and other areas of computer science.

  Sturmian words and generalizations have been the main focus of
  my investigation. Recently, I mostly concentrated on
  [Christoffel words](../tags/christoffel-words/)
  with their connection to number theory, and on
  [open vs. closed](../tags/oc-array/) (aka
  [*periodic-like*](../tags/complete-returns/)) prefixes of words,
  especially in the Sturmian and
  trapezoidal cases . We also found that Sturmian and Arnoux-Rauzy words
  have [*well distributed occurrences*](../tags/well-distributed-occurrences/),
  showing how this yields
  statistically valid pseudorandom number generation. In a different line
  of research, we characterized infinite Sturmian words in terms of the
  [lexicographic order](../tags/lexicographic-order).

  Previously, I had also focused on
  [rich words](../tags/rich-words/), a broad family containing
  (epi-)Sturmian words and their factors, from the point of view of
  [periodicity](../tags/periodicity/) and
  [complexity](../tags/factor-complexity/). Inspired by bioinformatics
  (Watson-Crick involution), we also introduced and studied some different
  generalizations of episturmian words, all based on
  [*special factors*](../tags/special-factors/) and
  [*involutory antimorphisms*](../tags/pseudopalindromes/) of the free monoid.
  In other papers related to
  [episturmian words](../tags/episturmian-words-and-morphisms/), we used and
  expanded the important tool known as (iterated) palindromic closure or
  [*palindromization*](../tags/palindromization/).

  My first efforts were devoted to finite factors of
  [Sturmian words](../tags/sturmian-words/),
  finding new characterizations (implemented as linear-time
  [algorithms](../tags/string-algorithms/))
  and studying the structure and
  [enumeration](../tags/enumeration/) of
  [palindromic](../tags/palindromes/) factors.
